The solution involves verifying that the HTML contains an element with the ID referenced in the CSS selector.  If the element doesn't exist, it should be added. Alternatively, the CSS selector can be adjusted to target a different, existing element or a more appropriate selector like a class. Below is an example where the element is added to the HTML and CSS remains the same.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>CSS Selector Fix</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="solution.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="myElement">
    This element now has blue background and white text.
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

```css
/* solution.css */
#myElement {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```
