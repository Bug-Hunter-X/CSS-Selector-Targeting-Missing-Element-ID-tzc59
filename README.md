# CSS Selector Targeting Missing Element ID

This repository demonstrates a common, yet sometimes subtle, error in CSS: using a selector that targets an element ID which does not exist in the corresponding HTML.  This can lead to unexpected visual outcomes or no styling changes at all.  The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `solution.css` offers a corrected approach.
