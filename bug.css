The CSS code has an unusual error that causes unexpected behavior.  The issue is that the selector `#myElement` is being used but there's no HTML element with that specific ID on the page. This results in the CSS rules not applying as intended.  The code is:

```css
#myElement {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```
